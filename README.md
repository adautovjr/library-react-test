# library-react-test
This is was a challenge proposed by an interviewer for me to create a simple system to manage books.
The interviewer only asked me to use typescript and React, but I decided to code it with Next.js as well. That way, I could not only achieve what the challenge was asking for, but I could also learn a new technology, which is something I always aim for.
